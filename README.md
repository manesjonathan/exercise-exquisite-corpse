##### **The Great Pumpkin of Cod**

I haven't blogged about this yet, but it has been the subject of many conversations at work. In fact, we've even been discussing this at every single all-hands meeting. Why? Because we're a software company and this is a programming blog.

But I think this is a serious issue.

And after all this time the **Great Pumpkin** of Cod had never been happy

- For nothing in the _ocean_ could be as **radiant** as him.

So he started eating **ice cream** and *chili*

*Malheureusement* la narratrice de cette partie de l'histoire ne parle pas très bien ***anglais***.

Elle espère néamoins, que le **Great Pumpkin** est heureux d'avoir pu manger sa glace.

***MAIS*** peut-être que le prochain narrateur aura un bout d'histoire plus palpitant à _raconter_.
