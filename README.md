## This is a story not really made by me

##### **The Great Pumpkin of Cod**

I haven't blogged about this yet, but it has been the subject of many conversations at work. In fact, we've even been discussing this at every single all-hands meeting. Why? Because we're a software company and this is a programming blog.

But I think this is a serious issue.

I was talking to a co-worker the other day, and he suggested that I tell his story to make a point. I agreed, and he proceeded to tell me how he has been working on a project for the last several months and has been "spending a lot of time trying to get the code to do what the customer wants".

It's a bit more complicated than that. But that's the gist of it. The customer hasn't given clear requirements, and our team has been trying to guess what they want the software to do. This is a big problem. The customer doesn't care whether it's done in C#, Java, or VB.NET. They just want it to do something.

The problem is that the team has been trying to do too many things at once. If they do get it working right, the customer will be happy, but if they make too many changes at once, they might break something.

You see, the customer has a very specific idea of what they want the software to do. They are a very experienced programmer who has a lot of ideas about what he wants to be able to accomplish with the software.
